Here's a list of topics to learn Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with Python, ordered in a structured manner:

1) Basics of OOP:
	Understand the fundamental concepts of OOP: objects, classes, attributes, methods, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
	Learn how OOP differs from procedural programming.
	
2)Classes and Objects:
	Define and create classes in Python.
	Understand class attributes and instance attributes.
	Create and manipulate objects from classes.
	Learn about constructors and instance methods.

3) Encapsulation and Abstraction:
	Understand encapsulation and how to use it to hide data and implementation details.
	Implement properties and accessors (getters) and mutators (setters) using decorators.
	Explore abstract classes and interfaces using the ABC (Abstract Base Class) module.

4) Inheritance:
	Understand inheritance and its benefits for code reuse.
	Create subclasses and derived classes.
	Override methods in derived classes.
	Explore multiple inheritance and method resolution order.

5) Polymorphism:
	Learn about polymorphism and how it allows objects of different classes to be used interchangeably.
	Implement polymorphism using method overriding and the concept of interfaces.
	Understand duck typing and how it relates to polymorphism in Python.

6) Advanced OOP Concepts:
	Explore class composition and aggregation.
	Learn about class attributes and static methods.
	Understand class inheritance and private/protected attributes using name mangling.

7) Design Patterns:
	Study common design patterns and their implementation in Python.
	Learn about patterns such as Factory, Singleton, Observer, Strategy, and more.
	Understand how to apply design patterns to solve common programming problems effectively.

8)Exception Handling:
	Learn about exceptions and error handling in Python.
	Understand how to raise and catch exceptions.
	Implement exception handling strategies to make your code more robust.

9) OOP Best Practices and Principles:
	Learn about SOLID principles (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion) 		and their application in Python.
	Study coding conventions and style guidelines for writing clean and maintainable object-oriented code.
	Explore testing and debugging techniques specific to OOP.

10) Practice and Projects:
	Apply your knowledge by working on projects that involve designing and implementing object-oriented systems in Python.
	Practice designing class hierarchies, utilizing inheritance and polymorphism effectively.
	Refactor and improve your code by applying design principles and best practices.

Remember to practice writing code and building projects to reinforce your understanding of OOP concepts. Working on real-world scenarios will help you solidify your knowledge and become proficient in OOP with Python.
